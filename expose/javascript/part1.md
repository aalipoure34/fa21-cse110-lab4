# Answers to Part 1 of the Expose Section.

- Question 1: Line 9 prints "values added: 20". Note that unless explicitly noted, when I say something is printed and I put it in quotes, I don't mean the quotes were printed but rather that I am showing what has been printed.
- Question 2: Line 13 prints "final result: 20".
- Question 3: Line 9 prints "values added: 20".
- Question 4: Line 13 prints nothing and gives an error. The problem here is that we're using let and result is now out of scope.
- Question 5: Line 9 prints nothing. We don't even reach there because the code tries to modify the value of a constant (result) on Line 5.
- Question 6: Line 13 prints nothing. We don't even reach there because the code tries to modify the value of a constant (result) on Line 5.
